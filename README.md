# Chess-In-C
An interactive chess program that applies graphical user interface (GUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) based opponent.

## AI:
For AI, the Minimax algorithm with pruning will be used. The depth of the MiniMax (or the number of steps to look-ahead) is defined in the difficulty level.

## Console and GUI:
The program has two modes:
- *Console mode* 
- *graphical mode (Gui mode)* - The graphical mode presents the user with visual menus and controls enabling the user to play Chess, choose the game’s players (user vs. user or user vs. computer, and set the game’s difficulty level in case the user is playing against the computer.
